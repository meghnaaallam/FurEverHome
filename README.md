Description
-----------------------
The FurEverHome application is a comprehensive solution designed to address the challenges faced by individuals seeking to adopt pets from local animal shelters, rescue organizations, or pet owners. The core idea is to create an intuitive and user-friendly platform that seamlessly connects prospective pet owners with their ideal furry companions.

By leveraging the power of JavaFX, the application provides an engaging interface that facilitates effortless pet searches. Users can easily navigate through various search criteria, including pet category (e.g., dogs, cats), seller type(i.e. “Donor”, “Seller”), and location, ensuring a personalized and tailored adoption/buying experience.

FurEverHome aims to simplify the pet adoption, buying, and selling process, connect potential adopters with their perfect furry companions, and contribute to increasing the number of successful and happy pet adoptions.
